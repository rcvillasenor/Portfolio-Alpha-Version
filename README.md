First Attempt at a professional portfolio using html, css, js.

April 20, 2023 Self Notes:
Could be improved upon/cleaned up: minor discrepancies I am currently not sure how to fix in terms of styling/responsiveness
between desktop website display and any changed formats whether it be mobile or minimized or other.

Main point to revisit:
CSS Box Model - there were some issues with the container for the contacts section that was adding extra unnecessary/unwanted
spacing in the content box (assuming we use CSS Box Model nomenclature). It could very well be some kind of unintended styling left behind but for now I am unable to figure out a solution.

Things I learned that I think were pretty cool with this project:

- The importance of data schema/planning out parent and child inheritances in terms of classes for styling purposes.
- I got more practice trying to debug styling and other issues with a bigger project such as this.

Will likely take what I've learned with this and apply it to future endeavors with creating portfolio websites.
